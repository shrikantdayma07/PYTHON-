#Functions in Python 


-Group of statements defined with a name 
-it is use for reusability 
-it is used for performing same task again and again without writing code again and again 

========================================================================================
#Types of Functions 

1] Built in function --->> comes along with the python software automatically, they are pre-defined 
eg.id(), type(), input(), eval() ,.....etc.  

#some built-in functions in Python are :
print(), eval(), count(), float(), frozenset(), len(), input(), list(), max(), min(), range(), set(), sum(), str(), type(), slice(), super(), tuple(), pow(), abs(), all(), format()

2] User defined function ---->> the functions which are developd by programmer explicitly according to business requirements, are called as user defined functions. 
- they are created according to user requirement. 

- we can defined user-defined function using "def" keyword !!

===========================================
#difference between implicit and explicit : 

Explicit means something is clearly stated, while implicit means something is implied or understood but not directly stated:

a] Explicit
Something that is clearly stated and leaves nothing to interpretation. For example, "We gave them explicit instructions" means the instructions were stated in detail.

b] Implicit
Something that is implied or understood but not directly stated. For example, "We had an implicit agreement" means the agreement was implied but never actually stated or written down.

=================================
#syntax of user-defined functions:

def function_name(parameters):
	"doc string"
	-------
	------

	return value 

1) Parameterized Functions --->> we pass the arguments or parameters inside the functions 
2) Non-Parameterized Functions --->>we do not pass the parameters inside the functions 
=====================================================================================
NOTE : we can call the functions using the function_name 

#in function we need not to mention datatype .. it automatically identify the datatype when we return or call the functions
=================================================================

#Parameters in the Functions :

- This is also called as Arguments 
- input of the function 

 There are 4 types of actual arguments are allowed in Python:

i]positional
ii]keyword
iii] default
iv] variable length 

#Variable Lengths Arguments : sometimes we can pass variable number of arguments to our function, such type of arguments are called variable length arguments .
-we can declare a variable length argument with * symbol as follows : def f1 (*n)
